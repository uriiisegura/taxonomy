This is because there is no blue pigment in their scales. They look blue, but they are not blue at all. If we zoom in on those scales we can see that they look like small trees. Those shapes, and more precisely their size, give that blue color. A light wave defines its color by its wavelength, and for most colors the wave reflected by the tree and the wave coming out after bouncing on the butterfly will be out of phase, which means that they cancel each other out. But this does not happen with blue. Blue has the precise right wavelength so that the reflected light waves are in sync and they make it to our eye. It is like a hall of mirrors that only lets blue light escape. There is even a pigment at the base that absorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure."

The blue disappears. For example, if you throw some alcohol on the wing, the blue turns green instead. Once the alcohol evaporates, the blue comes back. This would seem to be a problem since they would lose their color each time they get wet —with rain, for example—, but their wings are water-resistant and do not let water get inside the tiny tree-like structures."
